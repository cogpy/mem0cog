# üß† OpenCog-Inspired Cognitive Synergy Integration

This repository implements an enhanced version of mem0 with **OpenCog-inspired cognitive memory architecture** that provides intelligent memory synergy across parallel memory layers for enhanced AI context awareness.

## üöÄ Key Features

### üîó Cognitive Synergy Between Memory Layers
- **Parallel Processing**: Simultaneous processing across multiple memory subsystems
- **Cross-layer Associations**: Automatic creation of associations between different memory types
- **Synergy-based Ranking**: Enhanced memory retrieval with synergy scores
- **Context-aware Routing**: Intelligent memory operations based on cognitive context

### üß† Extended Memory Types
- **Working Memory**: Active information processing hub
- **Semantic Memory**: Factual knowledge and concepts  
- **Episodic Memory**: Personal experiences and events
- **Procedural Memory**: Skills, processes, and procedures
- **Declarative Memory**: Explicit, conscious memories
- **Associative Memory**: Connection-based relationships
- **Contextual Memory**: Context-specific storage

### ‚ö° Cognitive Context Management
- **Domain Awareness**: Healthcare, education, creative writing, etc.
- **Attention Focus**: Dynamic attention management
- **Cognitive Load**: Adaptive processing based on mental load
- **Emotional State**: Emotion-aware memory processing
- **Active Goals**: Goal-oriented memory operations

## üéØ Quick Start

```python
from mem0 import Memory, CognitiveContext
from mem0.configs.enums import MemoryType, CognitiveSynergyType

# Initialize memory with cognitive synergy
memory = Memory()

# Set cognitive context
memory.set_cognitive_context(
    user_id="doctor_smith",
    domain="healthcare",
    attention_focus=["patient care", "diagnosis"],
    cognitive_load=0.7,
    active_goals=["accurate diagnosis"]
)

# Add memory with cognitive synergy
result = memory.add_with_cognitive_synergy(
    "Patient shows symptoms of hypertension",
    user_id="doctor_smith",
    memory_types=[MemoryType.SEMANTIC, MemoryType.EPISODIC, MemoryType.WORKING]
)

# Search with multi-layer synergy
results = memory.search_with_cognitive_synergy(
    "treatment protocols for hypertension", 
    user_id="doctor_smith",
    synergy_types=[CognitiveSynergyType.WORKING_SEMANTIC, CognitiveSynergyType.WORKING_PROCEDURAL]
)
```

## üìö Use Cases

### üè• Healthcare AI Assistant
```python
# Medical knowledge integration across memory layers
memory.set_cognitive_context(
    user_id="doctor", 
    domain="healthcare",
    attention_focus=["diagnosis", "treatment"]
)

# Add medical facts, patient encounters, and procedures
# Search with cognitive synergy for clinical decision support
```

### üéì Educational AI Tutor  
```python
# Adaptive learning with cognitive memory layers
memory.set_cognitive_context(
    user_id="student",
    domain="mathematics", 
    cognitive_load=0.6,
    active_goals=["master quadratic equations"]
)

# Integrate concepts, experiences, and problem-solving procedures
```

### ‚úçÔ∏è Creative Writing Assistant
```python
# Creative synthesis across memory types
memory.set_cognitive_context(
    user_id="writer",
    domain="creative_writing",
    emotional_state="creative",
    attention_focus=["character development", "plot structure"]
)

# Combine writing craft, inspiration, and creative processes
```
