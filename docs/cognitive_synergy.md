# OpenCog-inspired Cognitive Memory Architecture

This document describes the cognitive synergy integration of parallel memory layers implemented in mem0cog, providing enhanced context-aware memory management for AI systems.

## Overview

The cognitive memory architecture extends mem0's existing memory system with OpenCog-inspired cognitive synergy between different memory subsystems. This allows for more sophisticated memory processing that mimics human cognitive processes through parallel memory layers and their interactions.

## Memory Types

The system now supports the following memory types:

### Core Memory Types
- **Semantic Memory**: Factual knowledge and concepts
- **Episodic Memory**: Personal experiences and events  
- **Procedural Memory**: Skills, processes, and procedures
- **Working Memory**: Currently active information and processing

### Extended Memory Types
- **Declarative Memory**: Explicit, conscious memories
- **Associative Memory**: Connection-based memory relationships
- **Contextual Memory**: Context-specific memory storage

## Cognitive Synergy Types

The system implements several types of cognitive synergy between memory layers:

- `WORKING_SEMANTIC`: Integration of active processing with factual knowledge
- `WORKING_EPISODIC`: Integration of active processing with experiential memory
- `WORKING_PROCEDURAL`: Integration of active processing with procedural knowledge
- `SEMANTIC_EPISODIC`: Connection between facts and experiences
- `SEMANTIC_PROCEDURAL`: Connection between knowledge and procedures
- `EPISODIC_PROCEDURAL`: Connection between experiences and procedures
- `MULTI_LAYER`: Complex multi-layer synergy integration

## Architecture Components

### CognitiveMemoryManager

The core orchestrator that manages parallel memory layers and their synergistic interactions.

```python
from mem0 import Memory, CognitiveContext
from mem0.configs.enums import MemoryType, CognitiveSynergyType

# Initialize memory with cognitive synergy
memory = Memory()

# Set cognitive context
memory.set_cognitive_context(
    user_id="user_123",
    domain="healthcare",
    attention_focus=["diagnosis", "treatment"],
    cognitive_load=0.7,
    active_goals=["accurate diagnosis"]
)
```

### CognitiveContext

Represents the cognitive state and context for memory operations:

```python
context = CognitiveContext(
    user_id="user_123",
    session_id="session_456", 
    domain="education",
    attention_focus=["learning", "problem solving"],
    emotional_state="focused",
    cognitive_load=0.6,
    active_goals=["master concepts"]
)
```

## Usage Examples

### Adding Memory with Cognitive Synergy

```python
# Add memory that will be processed across multiple layers
result = memory.add_with_cognitive_synergy(
    messages="Patient shows symptoms of hypertension",
    user_id="doctor_1",
    memory_types=[MemoryType.SEMANTIC, MemoryType.EPISODIC, MemoryType.WORKING]
)

print(result["synergy_activations"])  # Shows active synergies
```

### Searching with Cognitive Synergy

```python
# Search across multiple memory layers with synergy
results = memory.search_with_cognitive_synergy(
    query="treatment protocols for hypertension",
    user_id="doctor_1",
    synergy_types=[
        CognitiveSynergyType.WORKING_SEMANTIC,
        CognitiveSynergyType.WORKING_PROCEDURAL
    ]
)

# Results include synergy scores and layer information
for result in results["results"]:
    print(f"Memory: {result['memory']}")
    print(f"Source Layer: {result['source_layer']}")
    print(f"Synergy Score: {result.get('synergy_score', 0)}")
```

### Monitoring Cognitive State

```python
# Get detailed cognitive state
state = memory.get_cognitive_state(user_id="doctor_1")

print("Memory Layer Activations:")
for layer, info in state["memory_layers"].items():
    print(f"  {layer}: {info['activation_level']:.2f}")

print("Active Synergies:")
for synergy, info in state["synergy_edges"].items():
    if info["last_activation"]:
        print(f"  {synergy}: strength {info['strength']:.2f}")
```

## Configuration

Configure cognitive synergy in your memory config:

```python
from mem0.configs.base import MemoryConfig

config = MemoryConfig()
config.enable_cognitive_synergy = True
config.cognitive_synergy_config = {
    "max_parallel_layers": 6,
    "synergy_strength_threshold": 0.5,
    "working_memory_capacity": 150,
    "cross_layer_association_strength": 0.7,
    "cognitive_load_adaptation": True
}

memory = Memory(config)
```
